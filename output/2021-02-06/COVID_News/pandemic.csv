"The Supreme Court’s new, deeply fractured decision on churches and the pandemic, explained","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett arrive at the inauguration of President Joe Biden at the US Capitol on January 20, 2021. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images      Amy Coney Barrett just handed down her first Supreme Court opinion, and it’s surprisingly revealing The Supreme Court handed down an unusually messy order Friday night, in a case brought by a church claiming that it should be exempted from several rules California put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The justices split four ways in the case, South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, with members of the Court’s Republican majority divided into three different camps.Interestingly, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote her first signed opinion since joining the Supreme Court, and her opinion takes a position that is slightly to the left of her most conservative colleagues. Though Barrett’s opinion is still quite conservative, it suggests that there may be some daylight between her views and those of her most reactionary colleagues.South Bay involves a bevy of limits that California imposes on houses of worship, and on other places where people ordinarily congregate in large groups for extended periods of time. In the parts of the state with the most severe Covid-19 outbreaks, California mandated worship services be conducted outside to minimize the risk of infection. In areas where Covid-19 is less prevalent, the state has said services may be conducted indoors, but only at limited capacity — with stricter capacity limits in areas where the disease is more common.Additionally, the state bans indoor singing and chanting because, in the words of one of the state’s expert witnesses, “most scientists believe that group singing, particularly when engaged in while in close proximity to others in an enclosed space, carries a high risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus through the emission of infected droplets.”Significantly, these restrictions apply equally to houses of worship and to similar secular activities. Theaters, lecture halls, and other places where people gather in auditorium-like settings are subject to the same restrictions that apply to places of worship in their area. The ban on indoor singing applies to political rallies, school music recitals, and other secular activities, just as it applies to religious services. (Although there is one possible exception to the singing ban, which will be explained below.)Because the justices split four different ways in South Bay, it’s not at all clear what legal rule judges should apply in future, similar cases. But the Court’s order blocks the ban on indoor worship. It leaves the capacity limits and the indoor singing ban in place, for now, but the Court’s order also permits the plaintiffs to gather additional evidence and try to convince a lower court to strike down those limits as well.The Court’s four different opinions in South Bay, briefly explainedUntil last November, the Court’s religion cases drew a line between religious discrimination cases, where religious institutions were treated worse than comparable secular institutions, and cases involving a “neutral law of general applicability,” meaning that the law applies with equal force against religious and secular institutions.Religious liberty plaintiffs who could prove discrimination typically prevailed, while plaintiffs who challenged a state law that applies equally to religious and secular behavior typically lost their case. (A federal statute applies a stricter rule to federal laws that burden religious exercise, so religious liberty plaintiffs are much more likely to prevail in suits against the federal government than they are in suits against a state.)The night before last Thanksgiving, however, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, which vastly expanded the Court’s definition of what constitutes “discrimination” against religion. Prior to Roman Catholic Diocese, the Court’s decisions indicated that states were only required to treat religious activity the same as they do “analogous non-religious conduct.” So a state could impose restrictions on a church so long as the same restrictions applied to secular institutions that are similar in character to that church, such as lecture halls, movie theaters, and other places where people sit together for extended periods of time.Roman Catholic Diocese, however, blocked New York’s strict occupancy limits on places of worship because the same restrictions didn’t apply to secular businesses that are quite unlike houses of worship, such as “acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, [and] garages.” The Court’s decision in Roman Catholic Diocese suggested, in other words, that religious discrimination exists if a state treats any secular institution differently than a religious institution, no matter how dissimilar those two institutions might be.With this background in mind, let’s take a quick look at each of the four opinions in the South Bay case.Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, took the most expansive view of what constitutes religious discrimination. They would have blocked California’s public health limits on worship services in their entirety — although Alito would have stayed that decision for 30 days to give the state an opportunity to show that it absolutely must leave some restrictions in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Notably, these three justices were the only three who would have ended California’s ban on indoor singing, which they claim is discriminatory even though it applies equally to non-religious gatherings such as political rallies.California, Gorsuch notes, might permit indoor singing to occur on Hollywood film sets (although he admits that there is “some confusion over what rules actually apply to Hollywood”). Thus, by allegedly treating worship services differently than Hollywood film sets, Gorsuch claims that California discriminates against religion.It’s worth noting that there is a significant distinction between religious services and the film industry. As Justice Elena Kagan writes in her dissenting opinion, “film production studios in California ... must test their employees as many as three times a week,” and it would be extraordinarily difficult to apply a similar testing regime to houses of worship. But, under Gorsuch’s approach, this important distinction between film studios and places of worship is largely irrelevant.Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion, which was joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is slightly to the left of Gorsuch’s view. Though Barrett agrees with Gorsuch that “if a chorister can sing in a Hollywood studio but not in her church, California’s regulations cannot be viewed as neutral,” she concedes that the “record is uncertain” regarding what rules apply to film studios. Accordingly, her opinion allows the indoor singing ban to remain in effect, for now, while additional litigation takes place to figure out how the state treats Hollywood.Significantly, Barrett’s opinion also suggests that she does not want to tear down completely the distinction between cases involving religious discrimination and cases involving universally applicable laws. “It remains unclear whether the singing ban applies across the board (and thus constitutes a neutral and generally applicable law) or else favors certain sectors (and thus triggers more searching review),” Barrett writes.The Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith established the rule that neutral state laws of general applicability may be applied to religious institutions, but this decision has been under fire almost since the day it was decided. It is particularly loathed by religious conservatives, and there is a case pending before the Supreme Court right now which seeks to overrule Smith.Barrett’s opinion in South Bay, however, suggests that she may not be willing to go quite that far. And her decision to break with Gorsuch may be an early sign that she is a somewhat more moderate justice than the Court’s most conservative members.The four remaining justices all called for the Court to be more deferential to public health officials who are struggling to contain a pandemic. Writing only for himself, Chief Justice John Roberts emphasizes his view that “the ‘Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States.’” That said, Roberts also concludes that an outright ban on indoor services, even in areas with severe Covid-19 outbreaks, goes too far.Finally, Justice Kagan, in an opinion joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, scolds her colleagues for displacing “the judgments of experts about how to respond to a raging pandemic.” She concludes her opinion with a rhetorical flourish:[I]f this decision causes suffering, we will not pay. Our marble halls are now closed to the public, and our life tenure forever insulates us from responsibility for our errors. That would seem good reason to avoid disrupting a State’s pandemic response. But the Court forges ahead regardless, insisting that science-based policy yield to judicial edict. Kagan has historically avoided using harsh language, and she’s been quite open about her desire to broker compromises with her conservative colleagues that prevent radical changes to the law. That Kagan is now using such bleak terms to criticize her colleagues suggests that she may no longer believe such compromises are possible, now that the Court has a 6-3 Republican majority.What Barrett’s opinion could say about the futureAmy Coney Barrett is only 49 years old, which means that she could serve on the Supreme Court for three decades or more. And, while she is known to be quite conservative, it’s not yet clear whether she shares some of the most extreme views held by her more conservative colleagues. Her opinion in South Bay is the first sign since she joined the Court that she may be more moderate than, say, Justice Thomas.Like Thomas and Gorsuch, Barrett identifies as an originalist, meaning she believes that the Constitution’s words must be read as they were understood when they were ratified. Some originalists, such as Thomas, argue that courts must follow what they believe to be the original meaning of the Constitution even when such a decision would do considerable violence to the law. Thomas, for example, has suggested that federal child labor laws are unconstitutional.As a law professor, Barrett seemed to reject this extreme position, writing that there are some past decisions that “no serious person would propose to undo even if they are wrong.” In a 2016 article Barrett co-authored, she acknowledged that “adherence to originalism arguably requires, for example, the dismantling of the administrative state, the invalidation of paper money, and the reversal of Brown v. Board of Education,” but Barrett appears to recognize that it would be irresponsible for her to declare the dollar itself unconstitutional.It’s important not to overread these nods toward moderation in Barrett’s record. She is a very conservative judge. And it’s hardly an act of heroic restraint to declare that public school segregation should remain illegal, or that federal child labor laws should continue to exist.But if Barrett does tend to vote more like Kavanaugh — and less like Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch — that could matter a great deal in future cases.In the lead-up to the 2020 election, for example, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh all called for fairly radical changes to American election law — changes that are likely to disenfranchise countless voters if a fifth justice signs onto them. But Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch all signaled that they would apply such changes retroactively, meaning that voters who complied with the rules in place when they cast their ballots would be disenfranchised, if those voters failed to comply with new rules that were invented after they had already voted.Kavanaugh, at the least, was unwilling to go that far in a South Carolina case — a case that would have disenfranchised as many as 20,000 voters if Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch had gotten their way. Under Kavanaugh’s approach in that case, voters who followed the rules that were in place when they cast their ballots were not punished for failing to predict the future.Like Barrett, in other words, Kavanaugh is a rather conservative judge. But there is a significant difference between his approach to judging, and the often nihilistic approach taken by Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. And, if Barrett proves to be more like Kavanaugh than like the three most conservative justices, that means that she might put the brakes on some of the most extreme ideas — such as retroactively disenfranchising voters — supported by Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch."
"How the NFL tackled Covid-19 ","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","NFL fans convene in downtown Tampa, Florida, ahead of Super Bowl LV, on January 30. | Octavio Jones/Getty Images      Masks, distancing, testing, and proximity sensors: The NFL’s Covid-19 playbook, explained.  Beneath the shoulder pads of every player on the field in Tampa, Florida, during Super Bowl LV on Sunday will be small, white, rectangular gadgets. These devices are proximity sensors, measuring how close players come into contact with others and for how long. Developed by Kinexon, the units on the field are just several of the more than 11,000 such devices attached to belts and wristbands, or dangling from lanyards of players and staffers at the National Football League over the past season. They’ve been providing league officials with terabytes of data, and are part of why the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are facing off at all. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, every professional sports league has had to come up with a way to cope with the widespread transmission of this deadly disease. They’ve used different approaches — like the NBA, which resumed its 2020 season in a bubble, with the final stretch of games and playoffs held at Disney World in Florida. Surprisingly, many of the leagues found that the risk of transmission from player to player on the field, court, or ice is fairly low, which is why few players wear masks during games. The NFL’s approach, nonetheless, is one for the highlight reel. Near the end of the regular season, the league managed to contain the virus to fewer than 10 positive cases per week out of thousands of personnel. They accomplished this through a combination of mass testing, rigorous contact tracing, isolation of suspected cases, high-levels of mask-wearing, and social distancing. “They had a comprehensive approach,” said Davidson Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health who was not involved with the league. “It seems like they did all of these things successfully.”So successfully that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a case study last week looking at how the NFL managed to pull this off, examining the season between August and November 2020. During this period, the NFL found 329 confirmed cases of Covid-19, a positivity rate under 0.1 percent. The Covid-19 test positivity rate for the US as a whole is still around 7 percent. The proximity trackers were certainly useful to league officials, and the NFL also brought its immense financial resources to bear on the problem, but what sets the NFL apart is that they were able to get buy-in from their players, staffers, trainers, cooks, and coaches, all with the aim of hitting the gridiron every Sunday. That commitment to a central goal may prove to be the biggest challenge to replicate for anyone else trying to use the NFL’s playbook. The NFL’s Covid-19 strategy, explainedAt the start of the season, the NFL was still scrambling to figure out what actually worked to contain Covid-19. Rules were somewhat arbitrary and not always followed, and teams like the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans suffered large Covid-19 outbreaks. As the season progressed, teams started taking the pandemic more seriously, and the NFL shifted to a more aggressive set of rules to control the disease as officials gathered more information about just how the virus was being spread.                 NFL      The NFL had an extensive protocol for dealing with Covid-19 among its players and staff.  Here are some of the power players in the NFL’s lineup of tactics across its 32 teams. Testing: The NFL conducted more than 1 million tests for Covid-19, testing players daily and using a combination of rapid point-of-care tests as well as laboratory tests that delivered results in 24 hours. This disease surveillance allowed the league to find infections early and begin isolation protocols before the infected individual could spread the virus to more people.Tracing: The data from the Kinexon devices helped league officials trace the footsteps of infected people and find out who else had a high likelihood of being infected based on how close their contacts were and for how long. Researchers found that there were several cases of transmission between people with less than 15 minutes of exposure. Conversely, the league found no cases of transmission on the field during games, even though players weren’t wearing face masks. That’s likely due to their movement and ventilation available on the field. “We didn’t see the virus cross the line of scrimmage,” said Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, during the press conference on Thursday.                 Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images      The Kinexon tracking device worn by NFL players and staff helped the league trace the contacts of those who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.  The league found that after they implemented their intensive protocol, they found no high-risk contacts for 71 percent of cases that were traced, showing that the procedures made it far less likely infections would spread.Such granular, location-based data collection was invasive, and analyzing it was labor-intensive, but it allowed the NFL to better target its approach. Isolation: Infected individuals were told to isolate for five days and were tested during and after their isolation periods. Mask-wearing: The NFL found very quickly that wearing masks was an important way to limit the spread of the virus. “In 100% of cases, poor mask compliance was part of the transmission,” said Christina Mack, the lead author of the CDC report and vice president for epidemiology and clinical evidence at IQVIA, a health data analysis firm, during the press conference.However, getting just about everyone to wear masks at all times was a tall order, but players adjusted within weeks to wearing them at almost all times, even in the gym and during workouts. Players also had a little bit of peer pressure. “I think nobody wanted to be ‘that guy,’” said Anthony Casolaro, the team physician for the Washington Football Team, during the press conference. Coupled with the data collection, the NFL was able to deduce when masks were most effective. While there was no on-field transmission, exposure risks grew the longer people were in contact. That’s why the NFL’s guidance allows players to be maskless during the game but makes them mask up as they shake hands afterward. Reducing exposure: The league also took steps to limit opportunities for the virus to spread. Meetings were virtual. Players and staff were told not to carpool and were spread out across buses. Meals were provided in grab-and-go bags and no longer eaten together. Indoor spaces had sharp capacity limits. Accountability: There was not only a comprehensive, centralized plan, but people were named responsible to execute it. “It was very clear how to get things done, when to get things done, and who was going to do them,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, during the press conference. “I’ve never seen anything that organized, that quickly able to take action.”The NFL also took steps to punish individuals and organizations that failed to uphold the rules. Both the Ravens and the Titans received fines for breaching the league’s Covid-19 regulations. The lessons we can and can’t take away from the NFLSills said that while the NFL invested a lot in daily testing and extensive tracing, such elements weren’t enough on their own to control Covid-19. “Those were not the things that prevented transmission because we had all those things in place and had transmission in some cases,” he said.The things that did win the day for the league were tactics that anyone can use, like wearing masks and avoiding prolonged close contact. “These are lessons and strategies that can be applied in organizations, no matter what their resources are,” Sills said. Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health who was not involved with the NFL, said the league’s experience does demonstrate that there are alternatives to endless isolation and boredom during the pandemic. “I think it shows us that really thoughtful approaches to Covid-19 can really allow us to do some things,” she said.But even basic public health measures require time, effort, and money. People also have to be willing to follow the rules when no one is looking. “We can’t all have our own Covid babysitters,” Sell said. Without the shared mission and resources of an organization like the NFL, it’s much harder to build up a system to contain Covid-19.NFL officials did not lay out how much money and personnel it took to contain outbreaks among its players and staff. At the same time, there are hints at what might have happened if the NFL had not been so rigorous. The past college football season, which saw more than 100 canceled games and more than 6,000 infected players, might be an example. There are far more college football teams than NFL teams, and the pandemic was far more disruptive to college athletes, despite many schools’ best efforts to contain the spread. “They didn’t really have a unified approach,” Sell said. Meanwhile, the US as a whole has been struggling with all of the most basic measures to control Covid-19, with spotty and delayed testing, resistance to mask-wearing, and often inadequate social distancing — not to mention the lack of granular data that could come from gadgets like proximity sensors or even tracking smartphones. So cities, states, companies, and schools are likely going to continue stumbling under the burden of new cases of the disease. But as millions of Americans tune in to watch the big game on Sunday, they’ll get a glimpse of what’s possible if they were to team up, follow the same plays, and launch a drive toward the end zone of the pandemic."
"Israel outpaced the world in vaccinations. Now it’s seeing the results.","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Israelis get the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in a gymnasium in the central Israeli city of Hod Hasharon, on February 4, 2021. | Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images      There’s still a long way to go, but also a reason for hope. Israel has outpaced the world in vaccinating its population against Covid-19. Now the results are starting to come in. And, so far, the news is good for both Israel and the world. Data suggests that the pandemic is starting to slow in Israel. Infections and the number of seriously ill people are declining, particularly among those over 60, one of the groups targeted in the early rollout of the vaccination campaign.The vaccine, out in the wild, is also mirroring the results of clinical trials, which found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (the dose most Israelis have received so far) was about 95 percent effective in reducing infections.Maccabi Health Services, one of Israel’s four health maintenance organizations (HMOs), tracked 163,000 Israelis who had received both of the two required doses of the Pfizer vaccine; only 31 of those people tested positive for Covid-19, compared to an unvaccinated sample in which about 6,500 did.According to data from the Israeli Ministry of Health, 531 of 750,000 fully vaccinated people over 60 years old tested positive for Covid-19 — which is just 0.07 percent. Out of the people who tested positive, only 38 were hospitalized, with symptoms ranging from moderate to critical. Another Israeli HMO, Clalit, found that Covid-19 positivity decreased by 33 percent among 200,000 people 14 days after they’d received just the first Pfizer dose compared to the same number of unvaccinated people.This is all very promising, especially as the world banks on a vaccine as the best path out of this pandemic and as new variants of the virus emerge. “We say with caution, the magic has started,” Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, posted on Twitter, accompanied by data showing a decline in hospitalizations and critical illness among the 60-and-over group in recent weeks.Joint work with @ShalitUri @GorfineMalka @H_Rossman @smadarshilo @tomer1812 These patterns were not observed in the previous lockdown, see same graphs for second lockdownYesterday we showed even bigger drops in cities vaccinated earlier: https://t.co/fjVz6Rzf37 pic.twitter.com/yXrU3EBpig— Eran Segal (@segal_eran) February 1, 2021But scientists caution that there’s still a long way to go. Experts noted that serious cases are declining, but overall infections are not diminishing as swiftly. And many of these studies rely on preliminary data, so these findings may change over time, especially with these new coronavirus variants emerging.Israel also entered a strict lockdown in early January, just as the vaccination campaign was ramping up, which may have helped nudge cases downward. Who’s getting vaccinated, and how people might behave once they get those shots, may also influence the findings. Those who got vaccinated early and have gotten their full two doses might have been highly motivated; now comes the more challenging part of inoculating vaccine-hesitant or more marginalized communities. Israel has also faced criticism for its failure to extend its vaccination program to Palestinians, which could make herd immunity harder to achieve.Israel offers lessons in how to vaccinate a population quickly, but it’s also starting to show the challenges — and how difficult global immunization efforts are going to be. “Israel is the canary in the coal mine,” said Bruce Rosen, director of the Smokler Center for Health Policy Research at the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute (MJB) in Jerusalem.How Israel’s vaccination program offered a real-world vaccination test caseIsrael started its vaccination program in December. Since then, about a third of the country’s population (about 3 million people) has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly 1.8 million people have also gotten their second dose of the vaccine. That’s in a country of a little more than 9 million, according to recent figures from the Israel Ministry of Health.The rates are even higher for those in the over-60 group; for example, more than 90 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 have gotten the first vaccine dose, and nearly 80 percent the second. The vaccination program has since expanded so that anyone over the age of 16 is now eligible for a shot.                 Our World in Data  Israel achieved this largely because of its existing health infrastructure, a universal, digitized system that gave the country a ready-made way to track and communicate with people. All Israeli citizens are enrolled in one of four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for their care. Everyone has an ID number, which allows for easy access to electronic records. This system also allows health care workers to update a person’s vaccination status, monitor any side effects, and schedule an appointment for the next dose. Many Israelis said they got their appointment for the second dose shortly after getting injected with the first, usually scheduled for exactly 21 days later.This public health infrastructure meant massive vaccination sites popped up quickly, places that were accessible and big enough to be able to space people out and keep them as socially distanced as possible. Experts told me in January that Israel’s knack for responding in emergencies meant it was particularly suited for the logistical and speed challenges of a vaccination campaign.Israel also benefits from being a small country, and word of mouth did help in the vaccination rollout. Though Israel prioritized people over 60 and health care workers in the first phase of the campaign, it embraced a “no waste” policy, meaning vaccine providers prioritized using the doses above all else. If there were extra jabs at the end of the day or week, they might call in the pizza guy or the lady standing at the bus stop. “For a vaccination campaign, we are well-prepared, but we’re also flexible,” Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health, told me in January. “When you plan, you don’t know, for example, how the cold chain will look, how many vaccines you will get — so you need to make rapid adjustments. And we are good at that.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who, with elections approaching, has a lot to gain from a successful vaccination campaign) has said that Israel’s population could be fully vaccinated by the end of March.Experts said that’s still feasible, though it’s far from as simple as it sounds.Important questions remain around Israel’s vaccination program — and the world’s Israel’s data indicates that the vaccines are working at the individual level; the outcomes of those who have been inoculated compare favorably to those who haven’t. Israel’s streamlined health infrastructure makes it very easy to know who’s been vaccinated and how they’re responding, and compare it against those who haven’t.But that system is also helping it win the vaccine race in another way: In a world where vaccines are in short supply, Israel is getting a regular stream in part because the country promised to provide the vast collection of vaccine data to Pfizer, so it can monitor the effects of the vaccine. (Israel, however, also reportedly paid a premium for the vaccine doses.)  But experts said it only gets more complicated from here, especially when it comes to achieving the goal of herd immunity — basically, when enough of the population is immune to the virus that it provides indirect protection to everyone else.New variants of the virus pose a challenge, especially if those mutations make the virus better at getting around the protections offered by the vaccine. Right now, the vaccines available have been shown to be broadly effective against these variants, but that could change.There are other questions scientists and public health experts want to answer. Brian Wahl, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while the vaccines are effective against the disease, they’re still learning about its impact on transmission. That is, how likely it is that a vaccinated person who doesn’t get ill from Covid-19 could still spread it. Another question is how long the protection from the vaccine will last. “We need to be continuing to look at how well the vaccine protects several months beyond administration, Wahl said.This is also a new vaccine, and not everyone is enthusiastic about getting it. Often the people first in line for their doses want to be there; it doesn’t take much to get them to their appointments. This is not always the case for vaccine-skeptical or vaccine-hesitant people, and getting those people vaccinated is a challenge Israel, and other countries, face.Israel’s Arab and Orthodox Jewish communities show greater degrees of reluctance to getting the vaccine, and the latter has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.But Ann Blake, a postdoctoral fellow at Baylor College of Medicine who’s been studying  Israel’s efforts, said she feels optimistic about Israel’s ability to overcome some of this hesitancy. “Israel’s vaccination campaign showcases a coordinated and organized communications campaign that uses local community leaders and credible messengers in tandem with a synchronized message from the highest levels of government with the specific aim of encouraging vaccination among the vaccine hesitant,” she wrote in an email, adding that it could serve as a model for other countries, including here in the United States. Beyond hesitancy, experts pointed out that, right now, only people 16 or older are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, and scientists are unsure when kids will be approved for Covid-19 vaccinations. All of that leaves a chunk of the population that won’t get vaccinated and could still transmit the virus. “If you had 100 percent [of people] vaccinated, it would be one thing,” Rosen said. “But you don’t. So this is much more complicated in reality.”Israel has also faced criticism for excluding Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from its vaccination campaign, despite making the shots available to Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.Israel says that based on the terms of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian Authority is responsible for health care in the Palestinian territories. But human rights and health groups have pressured Israel to “ensure that quality vaccines be provided to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation,” arguing that restrictions imposed by the occupation limit the Palestinian Authority’s purchasing and distribution capabilities.The Palestinian Authority doesn’t have anywhere near the resources Israel does. The territories just received 10,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine (which appears to be safe and effective); they are also supposed to get doses through the Covax facility, the WHO-linked international consortium, but distribution won’t begin until later this month. Israel did send about 2,000 Moderna doses to Palestinian authorities this week, with a  promise of 3,000 more. But that is nowhere close to enough to serve the entire population of more than 4.5 million.If Palestinians lack safe and effective vaccines, that could also undermine Israel’s efforts at achieving herd immunity, especially since many Palestinian workers move back and forth into Israel every day. “We have to insist that Israel is responsible for Palestinian health as an occupier, especially during pandemics, and that infectious diseases do not know borders,” Rita Giacaman, a professor of public health at the Institute of Community and Public Health at Birzeit University in the West Bank, told me.Indeed, the uneven distribution of vaccines will ultimately prolong the coronavirus crisis everywhere. Israel’s example shows how a rapid campaign can work, but also the limitations of just one country succeeding against the pandemic."

"The Supreme Court’s new, deeply fractured decision on churches and the pandemic, explained","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett arrive at the inauguration of President Joe Biden at the US Capitol on January 20, 2021. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images      Amy Coney Barrett just handed down her first Supreme Court opinion, and it’s surprisingly revealing The Supreme Court handed down an unusually messy order Friday night, in a case brought by a church claiming that it should be exempted from several rules California put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The justices split four ways in the case, South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, with members of the Court’s Republican majority divided into three different camps.Interestingly, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote her first signed opinion since joining the Supreme Court, and her opinion takes a position that is slightly to the left of her most conservative colleagues. Though Barrett’s opinion is still quite conservative, it suggests that there may be some daylight between her views and those of her most reactionary colleagues.South Bay involves a bevy of limits that California imposes on houses of worship, and on other places where people ordinarily congregate in large groups for extended periods of time. In the parts of the state with the most severe Covid-19 outbreaks, California mandated worship services be conducted outside to minimize the risk of infection. In areas where Covid-19 is less prevalent, the state has said services may be conducted indoors, but only at limited capacity — with stricter capacity limits in areas where the disease is more common.Additionally, the state bans indoor singing and chanting because, in the words of one of the state’s expert witnesses, “most scientists believe that group singing, particularly when engaged in while in close proximity to others in an enclosed space, carries a high risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus through the emission of infected droplets.”Significantly, these restrictions apply equally to houses of worship and to similar secular activities. Theaters, lecture halls, and other places where people gather in auditorium-like settings are subject to the same restrictions that apply to places of worship in their area. The ban on indoor singing applies to political rallies, school music recitals, and other secular activities, just as it applies to religious services. (Although there is one possible exception to the singing ban, which will be explained below.)Because the justices split four different ways in South Bay, it’s not at all clear what legal rule judges should apply in future, similar cases. But the Court’s order blocks the ban on indoor worship. It leaves the capacity limits and the indoor singing ban in place, for now, but the Court’s order also permits the plaintiffs to gather additional evidence and try to convince a lower court to strike down those limits as well.The Court’s four different opinions in South Bay, briefly explainedUntil last November, the Court’s religion cases drew a line between religious discrimination cases, where religious institutions were treated worse than comparable secular institutions, and cases involving a “neutral law of general applicability,” meaning that the law applies with equal force against religious and secular institutions.Religious liberty plaintiffs who could prove discrimination typically prevailed, while plaintiffs who challenged a state law that applies equally to religious and secular behavior typically lost their case. (A federal statute applies a stricter rule to federal laws that burden religious exercise, so religious liberty plaintiffs are much more likely to prevail in suits against the federal government than they are in suits against a state.)The night before last Thanksgiving, however, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, which vastly expanded the Court’s definition of what constitutes “discrimination” against religion. Prior to Roman Catholic Diocese, the Court’s decisions indicated that states were only required to treat religious activity the same as they do “analogous non-religious conduct.” So a state could impose restrictions on a church so long as the same restrictions applied to secular institutions that are similar in character to that church, such as lecture halls, movie theaters, and other places where people sit together for extended periods of time.Roman Catholic Diocese, however, blocked New York’s strict occupancy limits on places of worship because the same restrictions didn’t apply to secular businesses that are quite unlike houses of worship, such as “acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, [and] garages.” The Court’s decision in Roman Catholic Diocese suggested, in other words, that religious discrimination exists if a state treats any secular institution differently than a religious institution, no matter how dissimilar those two institutions might be.With this background in mind, let’s take a quick look at each of the four opinions in the South Bay case.Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, took the most expansive view of what constitutes religious discrimination. They would have blocked California’s public health limits on worship services in their entirety — although Alito would have stayed that decision for 30 days to give the state an opportunity to show that it absolutely must leave some restrictions in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Notably, these three justices were the only three who would have ended California’s ban on indoor singing, which they claim is discriminatory even though it applies equally to non-religious gatherings such as political rallies.California, Gorsuch notes, might permit indoor singing to occur on Hollywood film sets (although he admits that there is “some confusion over what rules actually apply to Hollywood”). Thus, by allegedly treating worship services differently than Hollywood film sets, Gorsuch claims that California discriminates against religion.It’s worth noting that there is a significant distinction between religious services and the film industry. As Justice Elena Kagan writes in her dissenting opinion, “film production studios in California ... must test their employees as many as three times a week,” and it would be extraordinarily difficult to apply a similar testing regime to houses of worship. But, under Gorsuch’s approach, this important distinction between film studios and places of worship is largely irrelevant.Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion, which was joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is slightly to the left of Gorsuch’s view. Though Barrett agrees with Gorsuch that “if a chorister can sing in a Hollywood studio but not in her church, California’s regulations cannot be viewed as neutral,” she concedes that the “record is uncertain” regarding what rules apply to film studios. Accordingly, her opinion allows the indoor singing ban to remain in effect, for now, while additional litigation takes place to figure out how the state treats Hollywood.Significantly, Barrett’s opinion also suggests that she does not want to tear down completely the distinction between cases involving religious discrimination and cases involving universally applicable laws. “It remains unclear whether the singing ban applies across the board (and thus constitutes a neutral and generally applicable law) or else favors certain sectors (and thus triggers more searching review),” Barrett writes.The Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith established the rule that neutral state laws of general applicability may be applied to religious institutions, but this decision has been under fire almost since the day it was decided. It is particularly loathed by religious conservatives, and there is a case pending before the Supreme Court right now which seeks to overrule Smith.Barrett’s opinion in South Bay, however, suggests that she may not be willing to go quite that far. And her decision to break with Gorsuch may be an early sign that she is a somewhat more moderate justice than the Court’s most conservative members.The four remaining justices all called for the Court to be more deferential to public health officials who are struggling to contain a pandemic. Writing only for himself, Chief Justice John Roberts emphasizes his view that “the ‘Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States.’” That said, Roberts also concludes that an outright ban on indoor services, even in areas with severe Covid-19 outbreaks, goes too far.Finally, Justice Kagan, in an opinion joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, scolds her colleagues for displacing “the judgments of experts about how to respond to a raging pandemic.” She concludes her opinion with a rhetorical flourish:[I]f this decision causes suffering, we will not pay. Our marble halls are now closed to the public, and our life tenure forever insulates us from responsibility for our errors. That would seem good reason to avoid disrupting a State’s pandemic response. But the Court forges ahead regardless, insisting that science-based policy yield to judicial edict. Kagan has historically avoided using harsh language, and she’s been quite open about her desire to broker compromises with her conservative colleagues that prevent radical changes to the law. That Kagan is now using such bleak terms to criticize her colleagues suggests that she may no longer believe such compromises are possible, now that the Court has a 6-3 Republican majority.What Barrett’s opinion could say about the futureAmy Coney Barrett is only 49 years old, which means that she could serve on the Supreme Court for three decades or more. And, while she is known to be quite conservative, it’s not yet clear whether she shares some of the most extreme views held by her more conservative colleagues. Her opinion in South Bay is the first sign since she joined the Court that she may be more moderate than, say, Justice Thomas.Like Thomas and Gorsuch, Barrett identifies as an originalist, meaning she believes that the Constitution’s words must be read as they were understood when they were ratified. Some originalists, such as Thomas, argue that courts must follow what they believe to be the original meaning of the Constitution even when such a decision would do considerable violence to the law. Thomas, for example, has suggested that federal child labor laws are unconstitutional.As a law professor, Barrett seemed to reject this extreme position, writing that there are some past decisions that “no serious person would propose to undo even if they are wrong.” In a 2016 article Barrett co-authored, she acknowledged that “adherence to originalism arguably requires, for example, the dismantling of the administrative state, the invalidation of paper money, and the reversal of Brown v. Board of Education,” but Barrett appears to recognize that it would be irresponsible for her to declare the dollar itself unconstitutional.It’s important not to overread these nods toward moderation in Barrett’s record. She is a very conservative judge. And it’s hardly an act of heroic restraint to declare that public school segregation should remain illegal, or that federal child labor laws should continue to exist.But if Barrett does tend to vote more like Kavanaugh — and less like Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch — that could matter a great deal in future cases.In the lead-up to the 2020 election, for example, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh all called for fairly radical changes to American election law — changes that are likely to disenfranchise countless voters if a fifth justice signs onto them. But Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch all signaled that they would apply such changes retroactively, meaning that voters who complied with the rules in place when they cast their ballots would be disenfranchised, if those voters failed to comply with new rules that were invented after they had already voted.Kavanaugh, at the least, was unwilling to go that far in a South Carolina case — a case that would have disenfranchised as many as 20,000 voters if Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch had gotten their way. Under Kavanaugh’s approach in that case, voters who followed the rules that were in place when they cast their ballots were not punished for failing to predict the future.Like Barrett, in other words, Kavanaugh is a rather conservative judge. But there is a significant difference between his approach to judging, and the often nihilistic approach taken by Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. And, if Barrett proves to be more like Kavanaugh than like the three most conservative justices, that means that she might put the brakes on some of the most extreme ideas — such as retroactively disenfranchising voters — supported by Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch."
"How the NFL tackled Covid-19 ","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","NFL fans convene in downtown Tampa, Florida, ahead of Super Bowl LV, on January 30. | Octavio Jones/Getty Images      Masks, distancing, testing, and proximity sensors: The NFL’s Covid-19 playbook, explained.  Beneath the shoulder pads of every player on the field in Tampa, Florida, during Super Bowl LV on Sunday will be small, white, rectangular gadgets. These devices are proximity sensors, measuring how close players come into contact with others and for how long. Developed by Kinexon, the units on the field are just several of the more than 11,000 such devices attached to belts and wristbands, or dangling from lanyards of players and staffers at the National Football League over the past season. They’ve been providing league officials with terabytes of data, and are part of why the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are facing off at all. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, every professional sports league has had to come up with a way to cope with the widespread transmission of this deadly disease. They’ve used different approaches — like the NBA, which resumed its 2020 season in a bubble, with the final stretch of games and playoffs held at Disney World in Florida. Surprisingly, many of the leagues found that the risk of transmission from player to player on the field, court, or ice is fairly low, which is why few players wear masks during games. The NFL’s approach, nonetheless, is one for the highlight reel. Near the end of the regular season, the league managed to contain the virus to fewer than 10 positive cases per week out of thousands of personnel. They accomplished this through a combination of mass testing, rigorous contact tracing, isolation of suspected cases, high-levels of mask-wearing, and social distancing. “They had a comprehensive approach,” said Davidson Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health who was not involved with the league. “It seems like they did all of these things successfully.”So successfully that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a case study last week looking at how the NFL managed to pull this off, examining the season between August and November 2020. During this period, the NFL found 329 confirmed cases of Covid-19, a positivity rate under 0.1 percent. The Covid-19 test positivity rate for the US as a whole is still around 7 percent. The proximity trackers were certainly useful to league officials, and the NFL also brought its immense financial resources to bear on the problem, but what sets the NFL apart is that they were able to get buy-in from their players, staffers, trainers, cooks, and coaches, all with the aim of hitting the gridiron every Sunday. That commitment to a central goal may prove to be the biggest challenge to replicate for anyone else trying to use the NFL’s playbook. The NFL’s Covid-19 strategy, explainedAt the start of the season, the NFL was still scrambling to figure out what actually worked to contain Covid-19. Rules were somewhat arbitrary and not always followed, and teams like the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans suffered large Covid-19 outbreaks. As the season progressed, teams started taking the pandemic more seriously, and the NFL shifted to a more aggressive set of rules to control the disease as officials gathered more information about just how the virus was being spread.                 NFL      The NFL had an extensive protocol for dealing with Covid-19 among its players and staff.  Here are some of the power players in the NFL’s lineup of tactics across its 32 teams. Testing: The NFL conducted more than 1 million tests for Covid-19, testing players daily and using a combination of rapid point-of-care tests as well as laboratory tests that delivered results in 24 hours. This disease surveillance allowed the league to find infections early and begin isolation protocols before the infected individual could spread the virus to more people.Tracing: The data from the Kinexon devices helped league officials trace the footsteps of infected people and find out who else had a high likelihood of being infected based on how close their contacts were and for how long. Researchers found that there were several cases of transmission between people with less than 15 minutes of exposure. Conversely, the league found no cases of transmission on the field during games, even though players weren’t wearing face masks. That’s likely due to their movement and ventilation available on the field. “We didn’t see the virus cross the line of scrimmage,” said Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, during the press conference on Thursday.                 Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images      The Kinexon tracking device worn by NFL players and staff helped the league trace the contacts of those who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.  The league found that after they implemented their intensive protocol, they found no high-risk contacts for 71 percent of cases that were traced, showing that the procedures made it far less likely infections would spread.Such granular, location-based data collection was invasive, and analyzing it was labor-intensive, but it allowed the NFL to better target its approach. Isolation: Infected individuals were told to isolate for five days and were tested during and after their isolation periods. Mask-wearing: The NFL found very quickly that wearing masks was an important way to limit the spread of the virus. “In 100% of cases, poor mask compliance was part of the transmission,” said Christina Mack, the lead author of the CDC report and vice president for epidemiology and clinical evidence at IQVIA, a health data analysis firm, during the press conference.However, getting just about everyone to wear masks at all times was a tall order, but players adjusted within weeks to wearing them at almost all times, even in the gym and during workouts. Players also had a little bit of peer pressure. “I think nobody wanted to be ‘that guy,’” said Anthony Casolaro, the team physician for the Washington Football Team, during the press conference. Coupled with the data collection, the NFL was able to deduce when masks were most effective. While there was no on-field transmission, exposure risks grew the longer people were in contact. That’s why the NFL’s guidance allows players to be maskless during the game but makes them mask up as they shake hands afterward. Reducing exposure: The league also took steps to limit opportunities for the virus to spread. Meetings were virtual. Players and staff were told not to carpool and were spread out across buses. Meals were provided in grab-and-go bags and no longer eaten together. Indoor spaces had sharp capacity limits. Accountability: There was not only a comprehensive, centralized plan, but people were named responsible to execute it. “It was very clear how to get things done, when to get things done, and who was going to do them,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, during the press conference. “I’ve never seen anything that organized, that quickly able to take action.”The NFL also took steps to punish individuals and organizations that failed to uphold the rules. Both the Ravens and the Titans received fines for breaching the league’s Covid-19 regulations. The lessons we can and can’t take away from the NFLSills said that while the NFL invested a lot in daily testing and extensive tracing, such elements weren’t enough on their own to control Covid-19. “Those were not the things that prevented transmission because we had all those things in place and had transmission in some cases,” he said.The things that did win the day for the league were tactics that anyone can use, like wearing masks and avoiding prolonged close contact. “These are lessons and strategies that can be applied in organizations, no matter what their resources are,” Sills said. Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health who was not involved with the NFL, said the league’s experience does demonstrate that there are alternatives to endless isolation and boredom during the pandemic. “I think it shows us that really thoughtful approaches to Covid-19 can really allow us to do some things,” she said.But even basic public health measures require time, effort, and money. People also have to be willing to follow the rules when no one is looking. “We can’t all have our own Covid babysitters,” Sell said. Without the shared mission and resources of an organization like the NFL, it’s much harder to build up a system to contain Covid-19.NFL officials did not lay out how much money and personnel it took to contain outbreaks among its players and staff. At the same time, there are hints at what might have happened if the NFL had not been so rigorous. The past college football season, which saw more than 100 canceled games and more than 6,000 infected players, might be an example. There are far more college football teams than NFL teams, and the pandemic was far more disruptive to college athletes, despite many schools’ best efforts to contain the spread. “They didn’t really have a unified approach,” Sell said. Meanwhile, the US as a whole has been struggling with all of the most basic measures to control Covid-19, with spotty and delayed testing, resistance to mask-wearing, and often inadequate social distancing — not to mention the lack of granular data that could come from gadgets like proximity sensors or even tracking smartphones. So cities, states, companies, and schools are likely going to continue stumbling under the burden of new cases of the disease. But as millions of Americans tune in to watch the big game on Sunday, they’ll get a glimpse of what’s possible if they were to team up, follow the same plays, and launch a drive toward the end zone of the pandemic."
"Israel outpaced the world in vaccinations. Now it’s seeing the results.","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Israelis get the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in a gymnasium in the central Israeli city of Hod Hasharon, on February 4, 2021. | Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images      There’s still a long way to go, but also a reason for hope. Israel has outpaced the world in vaccinating its population against Covid-19. Now the results are starting to come in. And, so far, the news is good for both Israel and the world. Data suggests that the pandemic is starting to slow in Israel. Infections and the number of seriously ill people are declining, particularly among those over 60, one of the groups targeted in the early rollout of the vaccination campaign.The vaccine, out in the wild, is also mirroring the results of clinical trials, which found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (the dose most Israelis have received so far) was about 95 percent effective in reducing infections.Maccabi Health Services, one of Israel’s four health maintenance organizations (HMOs), tracked 163,000 Israelis who had received both of the two required doses of the Pfizer vaccine; only 31 of those people tested positive for Covid-19, compared to an unvaccinated sample in which about 6,500 did.According to data from the Israeli Ministry of Health, 531 of 750,000 fully vaccinated people over 60 years old tested positive for Covid-19 — which is just 0.07 percent. Out of the people who tested positive, only 38 were hospitalized, with symptoms ranging from moderate to critical. Another Israeli HMO, Clalit, found that Covid-19 positivity decreased by 33 percent among 200,000 people 14 days after they’d received just the first Pfizer dose compared to the same number of unvaccinated people.This is all very promising, especially as the world banks on a vaccine as the best path out of this pandemic and as new variants of the virus emerge. “We say with caution, the magic has started,” Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, posted on Twitter, accompanied by data showing a decline in hospitalizations and critical illness among the 60-and-over group in recent weeks.Joint work with @ShalitUri @GorfineMalka @H_Rossman @smadarshilo @tomer1812 These patterns were not observed in the previous lockdown, see same graphs for second lockdownYesterday we showed even bigger drops in cities vaccinated earlier: https://t.co/fjVz6Rzf37 pic.twitter.com/yXrU3EBpig— Eran Segal (@segal_eran) February 1, 2021But scientists caution that there’s still a long way to go. Experts noted that serious cases are declining, but overall infections are not diminishing as swiftly. And many of these studies rely on preliminary data, so these findings may change over time, especially with these new coronavirus variants emerging.Israel also entered a strict lockdown in early January, just as the vaccination campaign was ramping up, which may have helped nudge cases downward. Who’s getting vaccinated, and how people might behave once they get those shots, may also influence the findings. Those who got vaccinated early and have gotten their full two doses might have been highly motivated; now comes the more challenging part of inoculating vaccine-hesitant or more marginalized communities. Israel has also faced criticism for its failure to extend its vaccination program to Palestinians, which could make herd immunity harder to achieve.Israel offers lessons in how to vaccinate a population quickly, but it’s also starting to show the challenges — and how difficult global immunization efforts are going to be. “Israel is the canary in the coal mine,” said Bruce Rosen, director of the Smokler Center for Health Policy Research at the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute (MJB) in Jerusalem.How Israel’s vaccination program offered a real-world vaccination test caseIsrael started its vaccination program in December. Since then, about a third of the country’s population (about 3 million people) has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly 1.8 million people have also gotten their second dose of the vaccine. That’s in a country of a little more than 9 million, according to recent figures from the Israel Ministry of Health.The rates are even higher for those in the over-60 group; for example, more than 90 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 have gotten the first vaccine dose, and nearly 80 percent the second. The vaccination program has since expanded so that anyone over the age of 16 is now eligible for a shot.                 Our World in Data  Israel achieved this largely because of its existing health infrastructure, a universal, digitized system that gave the country a ready-made way to track and communicate with people. All Israeli citizens are enrolled in one of four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for their care. Everyone has an ID number, which allows for easy access to electronic records. This system also allows health care workers to update a person’s vaccination status, monitor any side effects, and schedule an appointment for the next dose. Many Israelis said they got their appointment for the second dose shortly after getting injected with the first, usually scheduled for exactly 21 days later.This public health infrastructure meant massive vaccination sites popped up quickly, places that were accessible and big enough to be able to space people out and keep them as socially distanced as possible. Experts told me in January that Israel’s knack for responding in emergencies meant it was particularly suited for the logistical and speed challenges of a vaccination campaign.Israel also benefits from being a small country, and word of mouth did help in the vaccination rollout. Though Israel prioritized people over 60 and health care workers in the first phase of the campaign, it embraced a “no waste” policy, meaning vaccine providers prioritized using the doses above all else. If there were extra jabs at the end of the day or week, they might call in the pizza guy or the lady standing at the bus stop. “For a vaccination campaign, we are well-prepared, but we’re also flexible,” Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health, told me in January. “When you plan, you don’t know, for example, how the cold chain will look, how many vaccines you will get — so you need to make rapid adjustments. And we are good at that.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who, with elections approaching, has a lot to gain from a successful vaccination campaign) has said that Israel’s population could be fully vaccinated by the end of March.Experts said that’s still feasible, though it’s far from as simple as it sounds.Important questions remain around Israel’s vaccination program — and the world’s Israel’s data indicates that the vaccines are working at the individual level; the outcomes of those who have been inoculated compare favorably to those who haven’t. Israel’s streamlined health infrastructure makes it very easy to know who’s been vaccinated and how they’re responding, and compare it against those who haven’t.But that system is also helping it win the vaccine race in another way: In a world where vaccines are in short supply, Israel is getting a regular stream in part because the country promised to provide the vast collection of vaccine data to Pfizer, so it can monitor the effects of the vaccine. (Israel, however, also reportedly paid a premium for the vaccine doses.)  But experts said it only gets more complicated from here, especially when it comes to achieving the goal of herd immunity — basically, when enough of the population is immune to the virus that it provides indirect protection to everyone else.New variants of the virus pose a challenge, especially if those mutations make the virus better at getting around the protections offered by the vaccine. Right now, the vaccines available have been shown to be broadly effective against these variants, but that could change.There are other questions scientists and public health experts want to answer. Brian Wahl, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while the vaccines are effective against the disease, they’re still learning about its impact on transmission. That is, how likely it is that a vaccinated person who doesn’t get ill from Covid-19 could still spread it. Another question is how long the protection from the vaccine will last. “We need to be continuing to look at how well the vaccine protects several months beyond administration, Wahl said.This is also a new vaccine, and not everyone is enthusiastic about getting it. Often the people first in line for their doses want to be there; it doesn’t take much to get them to their appointments. This is not always the case for vaccine-skeptical or vaccine-hesitant people, and getting those people vaccinated is a challenge Israel, and other countries, face.Israel’s Arab and Orthodox Jewish communities show greater degrees of reluctance to getting the vaccine, and the latter has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.But Ann Blake, a postdoctoral fellow at Baylor College of Medicine who’s been studying  Israel’s efforts, said she feels optimistic about Israel’s ability to overcome some of this hesitancy. “Israel’s vaccination campaign showcases a coordinated and organized communications campaign that uses local community leaders and credible messengers in tandem with a synchronized message from the highest levels of government with the specific aim of encouraging vaccination among the vaccine hesitant,” she wrote in an email, adding that it could serve as a model for other countries, including here in the United States. Beyond hesitancy, experts pointed out that, right now, only people 16 or older are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, and scientists are unsure when kids will be approved for Covid-19 vaccinations. All of that leaves a chunk of the population that won’t get vaccinated and could still transmit the virus. “If you had 100 percent [of people] vaccinated, it would be one thing,” Rosen said. “But you don’t. So this is much more complicated in reality.”Israel has also faced criticism for excluding Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from its vaccination campaign, despite making the shots available to Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.Israel says that based on the terms of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian Authority is responsible for health care in the Palestinian territories. But human rights and health groups have pressured Israel to “ensure that quality vaccines be provided to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation,” arguing that restrictions imposed by the occupation limit the Palestinian Authority’s purchasing and distribution capabilities.The Palestinian Authority doesn’t have anywhere near the resources Israel does. The territories just received 10,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine (which appears to be safe and effective); they are also supposed to get doses through the Covax facility, the WHO-linked international consortium, but distribution won’t begin until later this month. Israel did send about 2,000 Moderna doses to Palestinian authorities this week, with a  promise of 3,000 more. But that is nowhere close to enough to serve the entire population of more than 4.5 million.If Palestinians lack safe and effective vaccines, that could also undermine Israel’s efforts at achieving herd immunity, especially since many Palestinian workers move back and forth into Israel every day. “We have to insist that Israel is responsible for Palestinian health as an occupier, especially during pandemics, and that infectious diseases do not know borders,” Rita Giacaman, a professor of public health at the Institute of Community and Public Health at Birzeit University in the West Bank, told me.Indeed, the uneven distribution of vaccines will ultimately prolong the coronavirus crisis everywhere. Israel’s example shows how a rapid campaign can work, but also the limitations of just one country succeeding against the pandemic."

"The Supreme Court’s new, deeply fractured decision on churches and the pandemic, explained","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett arrive at the inauguration of President Joe Biden at the US Capitol on January 20, 2021. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images      Amy Coney Barrett just handed down her first Supreme Court opinion, and it’s surprisingly revealing The Supreme Court handed down an unusually messy order Friday night, in a case brought by a church claiming that it should be exempted from several rules California put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The justices split four ways in the case, South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, with members of the Court’s Republican majority divided into three different camps.Interestingly, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote her first signed opinion since joining the Supreme Court, and her opinion takes a position that is slightly to the left of her most conservative colleagues. Though Barrett’s opinion is still quite conservative, it suggests that there may be some daylight between her views and those of her most reactionary colleagues.South Bay involves a bevy of limits that California imposes on houses of worship, and on other places where people ordinarily congregate in large groups for extended periods of time. In the parts of the state with the most severe Covid-19 outbreaks, California mandated worship services be conducted outside to minimize the risk of infection. In areas where Covid-19 is less prevalent, the state has said services may be conducted indoors, but only at limited capacity — with stricter capacity limits in areas where the disease is more common.Additionally, the state bans indoor singing and chanting because, in the words of one of the state’s expert witnesses, “most scientists believe that group singing, particularly when engaged in while in close proximity to others in an enclosed space, carries a high risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus through the emission of infected droplets.”Significantly, these restrictions apply equally to houses of worship and to similar secular activities. Theaters, lecture halls, and other places where people gather in auditorium-like settings are subject to the same restrictions that apply to places of worship in their area. The ban on indoor singing applies to political rallies, school music recitals, and other secular activities, just as it applies to religious services. (Although there is one possible exception to the singing ban, which will be explained below.)Because the justices split four different ways in South Bay, it’s not at all clear what legal rule judges should apply in future, similar cases. But the Court’s order blocks the ban on indoor worship. It leaves the capacity limits and the indoor singing ban in place, for now, but the Court’s order also permits the plaintiffs to gather additional evidence and try to convince a lower court to strike down those limits as well.The Court’s four different opinions in South Bay, briefly explainedUntil last November, the Court’s religion cases drew a line between religious discrimination cases, where religious institutions were treated worse than comparable secular institutions, and cases involving a “neutral law of general applicability,” meaning that the law applies with equal force against religious and secular institutions.Religious liberty plaintiffs who could prove discrimination typically prevailed, while plaintiffs who challenged a state law that applies equally to religious and secular behavior typically lost their case. (A federal statute applies a stricter rule to federal laws that burden religious exercise, so religious liberty plaintiffs are much more likely to prevail in suits against the federal government than they are in suits against a state.)The night before last Thanksgiving, however, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, which vastly expanded the Court’s definition of what constitutes “discrimination” against religion. Prior to Roman Catholic Diocese, the Court’s decisions indicated that states were only required to treat religious activity the same as they do “analogous non-religious conduct.” So a state could impose restrictions on a church so long as the same restrictions applied to secular institutions that are similar in character to that church, such as lecture halls, movie theaters, and other places where people sit together for extended periods of time.Roman Catholic Diocese, however, blocked New York’s strict occupancy limits on places of worship because the same restrictions didn’t apply to secular businesses that are quite unlike houses of worship, such as “acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, [and] garages.” The Court’s decision in Roman Catholic Diocese suggested, in other words, that religious discrimination exists if a state treats any secular institution differently than a religious institution, no matter how dissimilar those two institutions might be.With this background in mind, let’s take a quick look at each of the four opinions in the South Bay case.Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, took the most expansive view of what constitutes religious discrimination. They would have blocked California’s public health limits on worship services in their entirety — although Alito would have stayed that decision for 30 days to give the state an opportunity to show that it absolutely must leave some restrictions in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Notably, these three justices were the only three who would have ended California’s ban on indoor singing, which they claim is discriminatory even though it applies equally to non-religious gatherings such as political rallies.California, Gorsuch notes, might permit indoor singing to occur on Hollywood film sets (although he admits that there is “some confusion over what rules actually apply to Hollywood”). Thus, by allegedly treating worship services differently than Hollywood film sets, Gorsuch claims that California discriminates against religion.It’s worth noting that there is a significant distinction between religious services and the film industry. As Justice Elena Kagan writes in her dissenting opinion, “film production studios in California ... must test their employees as many as three times a week,” and it would be extraordinarily difficult to apply a similar testing regime to houses of worship. But, under Gorsuch’s approach, this important distinction between film studios and places of worship is largely irrelevant.Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion, which was joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is slightly to the left of Gorsuch’s view. Though Barrett agrees with Gorsuch that “if a chorister can sing in a Hollywood studio but not in her church, California’s regulations cannot be viewed as neutral,” she concedes that the “record is uncertain” regarding what rules apply to film studios. Accordingly, her opinion allows the indoor singing ban to remain in effect, for now, while additional litigation takes place to figure out how the state treats Hollywood.Significantly, Barrett’s opinion also suggests that she does not want to tear down completely the distinction between cases involving religious discrimination and cases involving universally applicable laws. “It remains unclear whether the singing ban applies across the board (and thus constitutes a neutral and generally applicable law) or else favors certain sectors (and thus triggers more searching review),” Barrett writes.The Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith established the rule that neutral state laws of general applicability may be applied to religious institutions, but this decision has been under fire almost since the day it was decided. It is particularly loathed by religious conservatives, and there is a case pending before the Supreme Court right now which seeks to overrule Smith.Barrett’s opinion in South Bay, however, suggests that she may not be willing to go quite that far. And her decision to break with Gorsuch may be an early sign that she is a somewhat more moderate justice than the Court’s most conservative members.The four remaining justices all called for the Court to be more deferential to public health officials who are struggling to contain a pandemic. Writing only for himself, Chief Justice John Roberts emphasizes his view that “the ‘Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States.’” That said, Roberts also concludes that an outright ban on indoor services, even in areas with severe Covid-19 outbreaks, goes too far.Finally, Justice Kagan, in an opinion joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, scolds her colleagues for displacing “the judgments of experts about how to respond to a raging pandemic.” She concludes her opinion with a rhetorical flourish:[I]f this decision causes suffering, we will not pay. Our marble halls are now closed to the public, and our life tenure forever insulates us from responsibility for our errors. That would seem good reason to avoid disrupting a State’s pandemic response. But the Court forges ahead regardless, insisting that science-based policy yield to judicial edict. Kagan has historically avoided using harsh language, and she’s been quite open about her desire to broker compromises with her conservative colleagues that prevent radical changes to the law. That Kagan is now using such bleak terms to criticize her colleagues suggests that she may no longer believe such compromises are possible, now that the Court has a 6-3 Republican majority.What Barrett’s opinion could say about the futureAmy Coney Barrett is only 49 years old, which means that she could serve on the Supreme Court for three decades or more. And, while she is known to be quite conservative, it’s not yet clear whether she shares some of the most extreme views held by her more conservative colleagues. Her opinion in South Bay is the first sign since she joined the Court that she may be more moderate than, say, Justice Thomas.Like Thomas and Gorsuch, Barrett identifies as an originalist, meaning she believes that the Constitution’s words must be read as they were understood when they were ratified. Some originalists, such as Thomas, argue that courts must follow what they believe to be the original meaning of the Constitution even when such a decision would do considerable violence to the law. Thomas, for example, has suggested that federal child labor laws are unconstitutional.As a law professor, Barrett seemed to reject this extreme position, writing that there are some past decisions that “no serious person would propose to undo even if they are wrong.” In a 2016 article Barrett co-authored, she acknowledged that “adherence to originalism arguably requires, for example, the dismantling of the administrative state, the invalidation of paper money, and the reversal of Brown v. Board of Education,” but Barrett appears to recognize that it would be irresponsible for her to declare the dollar itself unconstitutional.It’s important not to overread these nods toward moderation in Barrett’s record. She is a very conservative judge. And it’s hardly an act of heroic restraint to declare that public school segregation should remain illegal, or that federal child labor laws should continue to exist.But if Barrett does tend to vote more like Kavanaugh — and less like Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch — that could matter a great deal in future cases.In the lead-up to the 2020 election, for example, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh all called for fairly radical changes to American election law — changes that are likely to disenfranchise countless voters if a fifth justice signs onto them. But Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch all signaled that they would apply such changes retroactively, meaning that voters who complied with the rules in place when they cast their ballots would be disenfranchised, if those voters failed to comply with new rules that were invented after they had already voted.Kavanaugh, at the least, was unwilling to go that far in a South Carolina case — a case that would have disenfranchised as many as 20,000 voters if Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch had gotten their way. Under Kavanaugh’s approach in that case, voters who followed the rules that were in place when they cast their ballots were not punished for failing to predict the future.Like Barrett, in other words, Kavanaugh is a rather conservative judge. But there is a significant difference between his approach to judging, and the often nihilistic approach taken by Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. And, if Barrett proves to be more like Kavanaugh than like the three most conservative justices, that means that she might put the brakes on some of the most extreme ideas — such as retroactively disenfranchising voters — supported by Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch."
"How the NFL tackled Covid-19 ","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","NFL fans convene in downtown Tampa, Florida, ahead of Super Bowl LV, on January 30. | Octavio Jones/Getty Images      Masks, distancing, testing, and proximity sensors: The NFL’s Covid-19 playbook, explained.  Beneath the shoulder pads of every player on the field in Tampa, Florida, during Super Bowl LV on Sunday will be small, white, rectangular gadgets. These devices are proximity sensors, measuring how close players come into contact with others and for how long. Developed by Kinexon, the units on the field are just several of the more than 11,000 such devices attached to belts and wristbands, or dangling from lanyards of players and staffers at the National Football League over the past season. They’ve been providing league officials with terabytes of data, and are part of why the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are facing off at all. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, every professional sports league has had to come up with a way to cope with the widespread transmission of this deadly disease. They’ve used different approaches — like the NBA, which resumed its 2020 season in a bubble, with the final stretch of games and playoffs held at Disney World in Florida. Surprisingly, many of the leagues found that the risk of transmission from player to player on the field, court, or ice is fairly low, which is why few players wear masks during games. The NFL’s approach, nonetheless, is one for the highlight reel. Near the end of the regular season, the league managed to contain the virus to fewer than 10 positive cases per week out of thousands of personnel. They accomplished this through a combination of mass testing, rigorous contact tracing, isolation of suspected cases, high-levels of mask-wearing, and social distancing. “They had a comprehensive approach,” said Davidson Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health who was not involved with the league. “It seems like they did all of these things successfully.”So successfully that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a case study last week looking at how the NFL managed to pull this off, examining the season between August and November 2020. During this period, the NFL found 329 confirmed cases of Covid-19, a positivity rate under 0.1 percent. The Covid-19 test positivity rate for the US as a whole is still around 7 percent. The proximity trackers were certainly useful to league officials, and the NFL also brought its immense financial resources to bear on the problem, but what sets the NFL apart is that they were able to get buy-in from their players, staffers, trainers, cooks, and coaches, all with the aim of hitting the gridiron every Sunday. That commitment to a central goal may prove to be the biggest challenge to replicate for anyone else trying to use the NFL’s playbook. The NFL’s Covid-19 strategy, explainedAt the start of the season, the NFL was still scrambling to figure out what actually worked to contain Covid-19. Rules were somewhat arbitrary and not always followed, and teams like the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans suffered large Covid-19 outbreaks. As the season progressed, teams started taking the pandemic more seriously, and the NFL shifted to a more aggressive set of rules to control the disease as officials gathered more information about just how the virus was being spread.                 NFL      The NFL had an extensive protocol for dealing with Covid-19 among its players and staff.  Here are some of the power players in the NFL’s lineup of tactics across its 32 teams. Testing: The NFL conducted more than 1 million tests for Covid-19, testing players daily and using a combination of rapid point-of-care tests as well as laboratory tests that delivered results in 24 hours. This disease surveillance allowed the league to find infections early and begin isolation protocols before the infected individual could spread the virus to more people.Tracing: The data from the Kinexon devices helped league officials trace the footsteps of infected people and find out who else had a high likelihood of being infected based on how close their contacts were and for how long. Researchers found that there were several cases of transmission between people with less than 15 minutes of exposure. Conversely, the league found no cases of transmission on the field during games, even though players weren’t wearing face masks. That’s likely due to their movement and ventilation available on the field. “We didn’t see the virus cross the line of scrimmage,” said Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, during the press conference on Thursday.                 Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images      The Kinexon tracking device worn by NFL players and staff helped the league trace the contacts of those who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.  The league found that after they implemented their intensive protocol, they found no high-risk contacts for 71 percent of cases that were traced, showing that the procedures made it far less likely infections would spread.Such granular, location-based data collection was invasive, and analyzing it was labor-intensive, but it allowed the NFL to better target its approach. Isolation: Infected individuals were told to isolate for five days and were tested during and after their isolation periods. Mask-wearing: The NFL found very quickly that wearing masks was an important way to limit the spread of the virus. “In 100% of cases, poor mask compliance was part of the transmission,” said Christina Mack, the lead author of the CDC report and vice president for epidemiology and clinical evidence at IQVIA, a health data analysis firm, during the press conference.However, getting just about everyone to wear masks at all times was a tall order, but players adjusted within weeks to wearing them at almost all times, even in the gym and during workouts. Players also had a little bit of peer pressure. “I think nobody wanted to be ‘that guy,’” said Anthony Casolaro, the team physician for the Washington Football Team, during the press conference. Coupled with the data collection, the NFL was able to deduce when masks were most effective. While there was no on-field transmission, exposure risks grew the longer people were in contact. That’s why the NFL’s guidance allows players to be maskless during the game but makes them mask up as they shake hands afterward. Reducing exposure: The league also took steps to limit opportunities for the virus to spread. Meetings were virtual. Players and staff were told not to carpool and were spread out across buses. Meals were provided in grab-and-go bags and no longer eaten together. Indoor spaces had sharp capacity limits. Accountability: There was not only a comprehensive, centralized plan, but people were named responsible to execute it. “It was very clear how to get things done, when to get things done, and who was going to do them,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, during the press conference. “I’ve never seen anything that organized, that quickly able to take action.”The NFL also took steps to punish individuals and organizations that failed to uphold the rules. Both the Ravens and the Titans received fines for breaching the league’s Covid-19 regulations. The lessons we can and can’t take away from the NFLSills said that while the NFL invested a lot in daily testing and extensive tracing, such elements weren’t enough on their own to control Covid-19. “Those were not the things that prevented transmission because we had all those things in place and had transmission in some cases,” he said.The things that did win the day for the league were tactics that anyone can use, like wearing masks and avoiding prolonged close contact. “These are lessons and strategies that can be applied in organizations, no matter what their resources are,” Sills said. Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health who was not involved with the NFL, said the league’s experience does demonstrate that there are alternatives to endless isolation and boredom during the pandemic. “I think it shows us that really thoughtful approaches to Covid-19 can really allow us to do some things,” she said.But even basic public health measures require time, effort, and money. People also have to be willing to follow the rules when no one is looking. “We can’t all have our own Covid babysitters,” Sell said. Without the shared mission and resources of an organization like the NFL, it’s much harder to build up a system to contain Covid-19.NFL officials did not lay out how much money and personnel it took to contain outbreaks among its players and staff. At the same time, there are hints at what might have happened if the NFL had not been so rigorous. The past college football season, which saw more than 100 canceled games and more than 6,000 infected players, might be an example. There are far more college football teams than NFL teams, and the pandemic was far more disruptive to college athletes, despite many schools’ best efforts to contain the spread. “They didn’t really have a unified approach,” Sell said. Meanwhile, the US as a whole has been struggling with all of the most basic measures to control Covid-19, with spotty and delayed testing, resistance to mask-wearing, and often inadequate social distancing — not to mention the lack of granular data that could come from gadgets like proximity sensors or even tracking smartphones. So cities, states, companies, and schools are likely going to continue stumbling under the burden of new cases of the disease. But as millions of Americans tune in to watch the big game on Sunday, they’ll get a glimpse of what’s possible if they were to team up, follow the same plays, and launch a drive toward the end zone of the pandemic."
"Israel outpaced the world in vaccinations. Now it’s seeing the results.","https://www.vox.com/2021/2/6/22270309/india-protests-farmers-blockades","Israelis get the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in a gymnasium in the central Israeli city of Hod Hasharon, on February 4, 2021. | Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images      There’s still a long way to go, but also a reason for hope. Israel has outpaced the world in vaccinating its population against Covid-19. Now the results are starting to come in. And, so far, the news is good for both Israel and the world. Data suggests that the pandemic is starting to slow in Israel. Infections and the number of seriously ill people are declining, particularly among those over 60, one of the groups targeted in the early rollout of the vaccination campaign.The vaccine, out in the wild, is also mirroring the results of clinical trials, which found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (the dose most Israelis have received so far) was about 95 percent effective in reducing infections.Maccabi Health Services, one of Israel’s four health maintenance organizations (HMOs), tracked 163,000 Israelis who had received both of the two required doses of the Pfizer vaccine; only 31 of those people tested positive for Covid-19, compared to an unvaccinated sample in which about 6,500 did.According to data from the Israeli Ministry of Health, 531 of 750,000 fully vaccinated people over 60 years old tested positive for Covid-19 — which is just 0.07 percent. Out of the people who tested positive, only 38 were hospitalized, with symptoms ranging from moderate to critical. Another Israeli HMO, Clalit, found that Covid-19 positivity decreased by 33 percent among 200,000 people 14 days after they’d received just the first Pfizer dose compared to the same number of unvaccinated people.This is all very promising, especially as the world banks on a vaccine as the best path out of this pandemic and as new variants of the virus emerge. “We say with caution, the magic has started,” Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, posted on Twitter, accompanied by data showing a decline in hospitalizations and critical illness among the 60-and-over group in recent weeks.Joint work with @ShalitUri @GorfineMalka @H_Rossman @smadarshilo @tomer1812 These patterns were not observed in the previous lockdown, see same graphs for second lockdownYesterday we showed even bigger drops in cities vaccinated earlier: https://t.co/fjVz6Rzf37 pic.twitter.com/yXrU3EBpig— Eran Segal (@segal_eran) February 1, 2021But scientists caution that there’s still a long way to go. Experts noted that serious cases are declining, but overall infections are not diminishing as swiftly. And many of these studies rely on preliminary data, so these findings may change over time, especially with these new coronavirus variants emerging.Israel also entered a strict lockdown in early January, just as the vaccination campaign was ramping up, which may have helped nudge cases downward. Who’s getting vaccinated, and how people might behave once they get those shots, may also influence the findings. Those who got vaccinated early and have gotten their full two doses might have been highly motivated; now comes the more challenging part of inoculating vaccine-hesitant or more marginalized communities. Israel has also faced criticism for its failure to extend its vaccination program to Palestinians, which could make herd immunity harder to achieve.Israel offers lessons in how to vaccinate a population quickly, but it’s also starting to show the challenges — and how difficult global immunization efforts are going to be. “Israel is the canary in the coal mine,” said Bruce Rosen, director of the Smokler Center for Health Policy Research at the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute (MJB) in Jerusalem.How Israel’s vaccination program offered a real-world vaccination test caseIsrael started its vaccination program in December. Since then, about a third of the country’s population (about 3 million people) has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly 1.8 million people have also gotten their second dose of the vaccine. That’s in a country of a little more than 9 million, according to recent figures from the Israel Ministry of Health.The rates are even higher for those in the over-60 group; for example, more than 90 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 have gotten the first vaccine dose, and nearly 80 percent the second. The vaccination program has since expanded so that anyone over the age of 16 is now eligible for a shot.                 Our World in Data  Israel achieved this largely because of its existing health infrastructure, a universal, digitized system that gave the country a ready-made way to track and communicate with people. All Israeli citizens are enrolled in one of four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for their care. Everyone has an ID number, which allows for easy access to electronic records. This system also allows health care workers to update a person’s vaccination status, monitor any side effects, and schedule an appointment for the next dose. Many Israelis said they got their appointment for the second dose shortly after getting injected with the first, usually scheduled for exactly 21 days later.This public health infrastructure meant massive vaccination sites popped up quickly, places that were accessible and big enough to be able to space people out and keep them as socially distanced as possible. Experts told me in January that Israel’s knack for responding in emergencies meant it was particularly suited for the logistical and speed challenges of a vaccination campaign.Israel also benefits from being a small country, and word of mouth did help in the vaccination rollout. Though Israel prioritized people over 60 and health care workers in the first phase of the campaign, it embraced a “no waste” policy, meaning vaccine providers prioritized using the doses above all else. If there were extra jabs at the end of the day or week, they might call in the pizza guy or the lady standing at the bus stop. “For a vaccination campaign, we are well-prepared, but we’re also flexible,” Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health, told me in January. “When you plan, you don’t know, for example, how the cold chain will look, how many vaccines you will get — so you need to make rapid adjustments. And we are good at that.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who, with elections approaching, has a lot to gain from a successful vaccination campaign) has said that Israel’s population could be fully vaccinated by the end of March.Experts said that’s still feasible, though it’s far from as simple as it sounds.Important questions remain around Israel’s vaccination program — and the world’s Israel’s data indicates that the vaccines are working at the individual level; the outcomes of those who have been inoculated compare favorably to those who haven’t. Israel’s streamlined health infrastructure makes it very easy to know who’s been vaccinated and how they’re responding, and compare it against those who haven’t.But that system is also helping it win the vaccine race in another way: In a world where vaccines are in short supply, Israel is getting a regular stream in part because the country promised to provide the vast collection of vaccine data to Pfizer, so it can monitor the effects of the vaccine. (Israel, however, also reportedly paid a premium for the vaccine doses.)  But experts said it only gets more complicated from here, especially when it comes to achieving the goal of herd immunity — basically, when enough of the population is immune to the virus that it provides indirect protection to everyone else.New variants of the virus pose a challenge, especially if those mutations make the virus better at getting around the protections offered by the vaccine. Right now, the vaccines available have been shown to be broadly effective against these variants, but that could change.There are other questions scientists and public health experts want to answer. Brian Wahl, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while the vaccines are effective against the disease, they’re still learning about its impact on transmission. That is, how likely it is that a vaccinated person who doesn’t get ill from Covid-19 could still spread it. Another question is how long the protection from the vaccine will last. “We need to be continuing to look at how well the vaccine protects several months beyond administration, Wahl said.This is also a new vaccine, and not everyone is enthusiastic about getting it. Often the people first in line for their doses want to be there; it doesn’t take much to get them to their appointments. This is not always the case for vaccine-skeptical or vaccine-hesitant people, and getting those people vaccinated is a challenge Israel, and other countries, face.Israel’s Arab and Orthodox Jewish communities show greater degrees of reluctance to getting the vaccine, and the latter has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.But Ann Blake, a postdoctoral fellow at Baylor College of Medicine who’s been studying  Israel’s efforts, said she feels optimistic about Israel’s ability to overcome some of this hesitancy. “Israel’s vaccination campaign showcases a coordinated and organized communications campaign that uses local community leaders and credible messengers in tandem with a synchronized message from the highest levels of government with the specific aim of encouraging vaccination among the vaccine hesitant,” she wrote in an email, adding that it could serve as a model for other countries, including here in the United States. Beyond hesitancy, experts pointed out that, right now, only people 16 or older are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, and scientists are unsure when kids will be approved for Covid-19 vaccinations. All of that leaves a chunk of the population that won’t get vaccinated and could still transmit the virus. “If you had 100 percent [of people] vaccinated, it would be one thing,” Rosen said. “But you don’t. So this is much more complicated in reality.”Israel has also faced criticism for excluding Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from its vaccination campaign, despite making the shots available to Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.Israel says that based on the terms of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian Authority is responsible for health care in the Palestinian territories. But human rights and health groups have pressured Israel to “ensure that quality vaccines be provided to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation,” arguing that restrictions imposed by the occupation limit the Palestinian Authority’s purchasing and distribution capabilities.The Palestinian Authority doesn’t have anywhere near the resources Israel does. The territories just received 10,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine (which appears to be safe and effective); they are also supposed to get doses through the Covax facility, the WHO-linked international consortium, but distribution won’t begin until later this month. Israel did send about 2,000 Moderna doses to Palestinian authorities this week, with a  promise of 3,000 more. But that is nowhere close to enough to serve the entire population of more than 4.5 million.If Palestinians lack safe and effective vaccines, that could also undermine Israel’s efforts at achieving herd immunity, especially since many Palestinian workers move back and forth into Israel every day. “We have to insist that Israel is responsible for Palestinian health as an occupier, especially during pandemics, and that infectious diseases do not know borders,” Rita Giacaman, a professor of public health at the Institute of Community and Public Health at Birzeit University in the West Bank, told me.Indeed, the uneven distribution of vaccines will ultimately prolong the coronavirus crisis everywhere. Israel’s example shows how a rapid campaign can work, but also the limitations of just one country succeeding against the pandemic."
